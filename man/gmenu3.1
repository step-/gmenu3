.SS
Keyboard Activation

In addition to invoking gmenu3 from the shell prompt, you may consider
assigning a global hotkey to start the menu. Linux Desktop environments
provide many different ways to do this. Refer to the documentation of
your keyboard manager for instructions. For Fatdog64 look up the Sven
Multimedia Keyboard Manager icon that sits in the panel.

.SS
Click Activation

Here is a sample shell script for X11 systems that invokes gmenu3 when the
user right-clicks on a free area of the root window. The script will not be
able to detect clicks if another application--such as a window manager like
Openbox--is already monitoring the root window.

.EX
#!/bin/sh

# This script intercepts button-3 (right) clicks on the X11
# root window, invoking $MENU when the button is released.

MENU=gmenu3

pid=$(pgrep -xU $(id -u) "${0##*}")
if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
	echo "${0##*/} is already running (pid $pid)"
	exit
fi

trap "pkill -P $$ -x xev" HUP INT ALRM TERM 0

xev -root -event button -event owner_grab_button |
grep --line-buffered -A3 "ButtonRelease.*YES" |
while read EVENT; do
	case "$EVENT" in
		*'0,'*'button 3'*) ( $MENU >/dev/null 2>&1 & ) ;;
	esac
